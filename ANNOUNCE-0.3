announces the 0.3 release of CEC, the Columbia Esterel Compiler

http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/cec/

This is the second release of CEC.  The main new feature is efficient
C code generation, which joins its existing facility to compile
Esterel into either BLIF or Verilog formats.  It supports
user-specified encodings for local state machines.

CEC is implemented in C++ and is released under the BSD license.

Source is available, as are precompiled RPM packages for Red Hat
Linux.  Compilation from source requires gcc 3.0 or equivalent and
expat 1.95.  The 0.3 release includes source for the ANTLR run-time
library, so installing ANTLR to compile CEC from source is no longer
required.
