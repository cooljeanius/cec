This is the ANTLR runtime library from the ANTLR 2.7.2 release.

These directories were constructed by copying all .hpp files from
antlr-2.7.2/lib/cpp/antlr into antlr/ and all .cpp files (save dll.cpp) from
antlr-2.7.2/lib/cpp/src in src/

This becomes a library (libantlr.a) that is statically linked into the
compiler front-end, eliminating the need for any ANTLR installation in the
end.

Please see the file COPYING in this directory for copyright information
for this library.
