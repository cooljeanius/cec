This is cec, the Columbia Esterel Compiler.

Esterel is a synchronous language developed by Gerard Berry et al.
See www.esterel-technologies.com for documentation on the language.

This is an automake/autoconf-based project.  Compilation can be as
simple as

./configure
make

Compilation requires the expat XML parser.  Configuration will fail if
it is not found.  In addition to may packaged copies, expat can be found at
http://www.jclark.com/xml/expat.html

Rebuilding from primary sources (only necessary for developers)
requires the noweb system, the ANTLR parser generator (version 2.7.2),
a TeX distribution to generate the documentation, and Ghostscript to
convert Postscript to PDF.

There is a bug in the noweb.sty file in the noweb-2.10a release that
can be fixed by adding the line

\@savsf=1

at the beginning.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Much of the system is documented using Norman Ramsey's Noweb system.
See http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/noweb/ for details.

The compiler uses XML as an on-disk intermediate representation.
See IR.pdf for a description.

The AST and GRC intermediate representations are described in the file AST.pdf.

High-level dismantlers are described in Dismantle.pdf.

The AST-to-GRC dismantler is described in ASTGRC.pdf.

The Esterel grammar is in esterel.g.

The static semantic checker is in staticsemantics.g
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This compiler is built using Terrance Parr et al.'s ANTLR system.
A unmodified copy of the C++ runtime library from ANTLR 2.7.2 is
included in the libantlr/ directory to reduce compilation dependencies.
