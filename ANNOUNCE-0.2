announces the 0.2 release of CEC, the Columbia Esterel Compiler

http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/cec/

This is the first functional release of CEC.  It compiles a subset of
Esterel V5 into circuits in either BLIF or Verilog format.  It
supports user-specified encodings for local state machines.

CEC is implemented in C++ and is released under the BSD license.

Source is available, as are precompiled RPM packages for Red Hat
Linux.  Compilation from source requires gcc 3.0 or equivalent,
ANTLR 2.7.2, and expat 1.95.
