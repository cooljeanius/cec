The Columbia Languages and Compilers group

announces the 0.4 release of CEC, the Columbia Esterel Compiler

http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/cec/

This is the third release of CEC.  It adds two new C code generators:
one based on program dependence graphs, which generates fast code,
and one based on a virtual machine, which generates small code.

In addition, may bugs have been fixed and many new testcases have been added.

CEC is implemented in C++ and is released under the BSD license.

Source is available, as are precompiled RPM packages for Fedora Core
Linux.  Compilation from source requires gcc 3.0 or newer and the
expat 1.95 libray.
